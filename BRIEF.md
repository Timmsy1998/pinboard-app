# Technical Test

This task is intended to test candidates' ability to consume a webpage, process some data, and present it back. While there is no specific time limit, we would not expect candidates to spend any longer than a few hours completing this.

Candidates are strongly encouraged to use any third-party libraries they would like. We are looking for concise, testable, clean, well-commented code and to see that candidates have chosen the right tools for the right job.

Please note that while we have said that we would like the code to be testable, we do not require that the candidates produce tests as part of this work, in order not to use more time than necessary.

## Requirements

The code should:

- Include a `README.md` file in the root describing how to run the app, how to run any tests, and install any dependencies required.
- Work on PHP 8.1+
- Candidates may use a dependency management system (e.g., composer and npm) and as many dependencies as required - part of the assessment will include the choice of any appropriate dependencies.

## Task

We would like candidates to build an example Laravel app, with the following components:

1. **Command**: A command that will look through the links posted in the main column of the first page of https://pinboard.in/u:alasdairw?per_page=120 for any links that have been tagged with any of the following tags: “laravel”, “vue”, “vue.js”, “php”, or “api”, and saves the URLs along with the title, comments, and any tags they have to a database. The script should also check if the URLs are still valid/live and save that information to the database as well. (MySql or sqlite.)
2. **API Route**: An API route that returns JSON to support the following:
3. **Front-end**: A single front-end URL that makes use of Vue.js that will display those 4 tags, and allow the user to select one or more of them, and then display all the links in the database that match all the chosen tags. (So if multiple tags are chosen, and a link matches only one of the chosen tags, it should *not* display.)

## Notes

- The code should be concise, testable, clean, and well-commented.
- Use any third-party libraries as needed.
- Include a `README.md` file with instructions on how to run the app and install dependencies.
- Candidates must not make use of Chat-GPT, Co-pilot or any other AI based code generation tools.
